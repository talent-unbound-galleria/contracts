<p>We believe that every child is a genius on a Hero's Journey to change the world.</p>

<a id="hero-buck-contract" class="anchor" href="#hero-buck-contract" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hero Buck Contract</h1>

<p>As part of the Hero Bucks Process, I affirm the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>I understand that if I break one of the promises on the Price List, I will be held accountable by being asked for a Hero Buck.</li>
<li>I will not give warnings.</li>
<li>I am not allowed to ask for a Hero Buck after the fact (i.e., you cannot ask for a Hero Buck if it was for something that was more than 30 minutes ago).</li>
<li>Two people cannot ask someone for a Hero Buck at the same time for the same thing.</li>
<li>I further promise to accept this discipline respectfully, whether I agree with the person or not.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="honor-code-violation-process" class="anchor" href="#honor-code-violation-process" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Honor Code Violation Process</h3>

<p>I, as a Talent Unbound Hero, understand that I must regard the following rules as obligations that must be complete:</p>

<ul>
<li>If I commit an Honor Code Violation, I promise to write a speech that represents my best work and share it publicly in front of the entire class and Guides. I will apologize sincerely and state what I will do next time to prove I am worthy to be here.</li>
<li>All appeals will be in writing, and done within one hour of being notified of an Honor Code Violation.</li>
<li>If I apologize of my own accord without being warned, the class and Guides may vote on whether or not what I have done counts as an Honor Code Violation. Whatever the class decides, I promise to respect their decision either way.</li>
<li>If I refuse to apologize, my studio-mate or Guides have permission to complete the task for me, although I must stand up alongside whoever is selected to state what I have done wrong.</li>
<li>I will then spend one day at home, away from school or until I can re-commit to upholding the community standards and resuming my role as a full participant on my journey at Talent Unbound. The first day I enter Talent Unbound after I have left, I will publicly share my recommitments I have pondered while at home with the community.</li>
<li>The third time I commit a violation, I will leave Talent Unbound for good.</li>
<li>Being sent home because of Strike Three counts as one of my three Honor Code Violations as well.</li>
<li>For every two years I have not been accused of an Honor Code Violation, one of my violations are removed.</li>
</ul>
