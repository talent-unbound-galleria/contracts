I will apologize sincerely and state what I will do next time to prove I am worthy to be here.\r\n- All appeals will be in writing, and done within one hour of being notified of an honor code violation.\r\n- If I apologize of my own accord without being warned, the class and Guides may vote on whether or not what I have done counts as an Honor Code Violation. Whatever the class decides, I promise to respect their decision either way.\r\n- If I refuse to apologize, my studio-mate or Guides have permission to complete the task for me, although I must stand up alongside whoever is selected to state what I have done wrong.\r\n- I will then spend one day at home, away from school or until I can re-commit to upholding the community standards and resuming my role as a full participant on my journey at Talent Unbound. The first day I enter Talent Unbound after I have left, I will publicly share my recommitments I have pondered while at home with the community.\r\n- The third time I commit a violation, I will leave Talent Unbound for good.\r\n- Being sent home because of Strike Three counts as one of my three Honor Code Violations as well.\r\n- For every two years I have not been accused of an Honor-Code Violation, one of my violations are removed.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
