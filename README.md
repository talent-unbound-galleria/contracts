- I understand that if I break one of the promises on the Price List, I will be held accountable by being asked for a Hero Buck.

### Honor Code Violation Process

I, as a Talent Unbound Hero, understand that I must regard the following rules as obligations that must be complete:

- If I commit an Honor Code Violation, I promise to write a speech that represents my best work and share it publicly in front of the entire class and Guides. I will apologize sincerely and state what I will do next time to prove I am worthy to be here.
- All appeals will be in writing, and done within one hour of being notified of an Honor Code Violation.
- If I apologize of my own accord without being warned, the class and Guides may vote on whether or not what I have done counts as an Honor Code Violation. Whatever the class decides, I promise to respect their decision either way.
- If I refuse to apologize, my studio-mate or Guides have permission to complete the task for me, although I must stand up alongside whoever is selected to state what I have done wrong.
- I will then spend one day at home, away from school or until I can re-commit to upholding the community standards and resuming my role as a full participant on my journey at Talent Unbound. The first day I enter Talent Unbound after I have left, I will publicly share my recommitments I have pondered while at home with the community.
- The third time I commit a violation, I will leave Talent Unbound for good.
- Being sent home because of Strike Three counts as one of my three Honor Code Violations as well.
- For every two years I have not been accused of an Honor Code Violation, one of my violations are removed.
